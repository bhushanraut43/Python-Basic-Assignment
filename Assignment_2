1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Ans- 
     the values of Boolean fata type is True or False
         50>14    or    print(50>14)        - False
         50<14    or    print(50<14)        - False




2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Ans-
AND, OR, NOT




3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
Ans-
  X       Y    not of x   x AND y  x OR y
false   false    true     false    false
false   true     true     false    true
true    false    false    false    true
true    true     false    true     true


4. What are the values of the following expressions?
Ans:
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)              - False
not (5 > 4)                       - False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)               - True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))         - False
(True and True) and (True == False)       - False
(not False) or (not True)                  -True




5. What are the six comparison operators?
Ans-
 >  greater than
 <  less than
>= greater than or equal to
<= less than or equal to
== equal
!= not equal




6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
Ans-
= used to assign the value at the variable
and == used for checking the two operands equal or not equal

1) =  a="hi"
2) =  22==22



7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')

Ans-

print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
    print('bacon')
else:
    print('ham')
print('spam')

because its inside if statement.




8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

Ans-

spam = int(input())

if spam == 1:
    print('Hello')
elif spam == 2:
    print('Howdy')
else:
    print('Greetings!')




9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?

Ans- CTRL + C




10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Ans- break can terminates or exit
     And the continue can skip rest of the code in loop. It not jump out of the loop, it will skip further execution. 
         
         
         
         
11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Ans-
range(10)- it prints 0 to 9 numbers
range(0, 10)- it also prints 0 to 9 numbers
range(0, 10, 1)- it also prints 0 to 9 numbers and if we replace 1 of 2 or something, its make difference. 




12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

Ans- 1)for i in range(1, 11):
             print(i)

      2) i = 1
         while(i<=10):
            print(i)
            i += 1


13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?

Ans-
spam.bacon()
